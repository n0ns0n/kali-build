# kali-build
Inspired by [IppSec's "Building Parrot with Ansible"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLidcsTyj9JXJVIFqyHBHzrRYKPpZYFjM8) series, I decided to do the same but on Kali Linux. The configurations and customizations applied are the ones I always do on my VMs; thus, they may not be suitable for someone else's setup.

The scripts will:
- Configure a custom theme for xfce4 using Kali-X and Vibrancy-Kali (old Kali theme).
- Set up some custom desktop wallpapers.
- Apply custom configurations for Firefox.
- Install and configure tools/utilities such as Sublime Text and Cherrytree.
- And more.

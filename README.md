# kali-build
Inspired by IppSec's building parrot with ansible series, I decided to do the same but on Kali Linux. The configurations and customizations appplied are the ones I allways do on my VMs, thus they may not be suitable for someone else's setup

The scripts will:
- Configure a custom theme for xfce4 using Kali-X and Vibrancy-Kali (old kali theme)
- Set up some custom desktop wallpappers
- Do some custom configurations for firefox
- Install and configure tools/utilities such as Sublime-Text and Cherrytree
- And more.
